# systemddeployer
script for making executable systemd enabled.


This script aims to enable any executable program to systemD.  Just pass the desired executable file name as parameter 
& get it added as a system service.  All systemD commands can obviously be accessed via command line.

Note:  You will have to use sudo in order to move the file to default systemD directory & enable it via systemD.
